4. Multiple variables in a single line
Demonstrates declaring and initializing multiple variables in one statement, then printing their values.

5. Data types and size of an integer

Illustrates declaring a double variable and printing it with default and fixed decimal precision.

7. Float number
Shows the declaration of a float variable and printing with default and specified decimal places.

8. Character data type
Demonstrates storing and printing a character, as well as its ASCII integer value.

9. User input for integer
Explains how to take input from the user using scanf and print the received value.

10. Take multiple inputs together
Demonstrates reading multiple inputs of different data types in one scanf call.
